		<p class="tutInfo"> The Game Master tells a collaborative story with the players. When an outcome must be decided (i.e a player performs an action, tries to do something), hit ROLL and you will get either YES, AND - YES, BUT - NO, AND - NO, BUT. 
			<ul>
				<li> If you roll YES, AND: the player succeeds and gets a further success. </li>
				<li> If you roll YES, BUT: the player succeeds but there is a minor drawback or penalty. </li>
				<li> If you roll NO, AND: the player fails and suffers further penalty. </li>
				<li> If you roll NO, BUT: the player fails but there is a minor consolation. </li>
			</ul>
		<p class="tutInfo">
		Each roll will give you THREE random words. Your AND/BUT response should involve one of the words! Be creative and be open to vivid interpretation. 	
For example: The player may be attempting to persuade the king to give them gold. If the roll is YES, BUT. and the words are: TOOTHBRUSH, ROCK, PLURAL. The outcome may be: The player succeeds and the king agrees to give the player some gold, BUT due to his poor hygiene (TOOTHPASTE) the player is hit like a rock (ROCK) with his
bad breath. 
Note that you can use just one of the provided words or you can use multiple.</p>
